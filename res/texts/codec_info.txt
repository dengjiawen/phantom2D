ENCODING AND DECODING IN PHANTOM2D
------------------------------------------------------------------

Phantom2D uses numbered frame sequences as the primary input and output. 

To import and edit a movie clip as part of sequence Phantom2D decodes it to a frame sequence placed in a folder in the user defined import folder. The default program used to import clips is FFMPEG.

To create a movie clip from rendered frame sequence Phantom2D used a encoder program. The default program used to encode clips is MENCODER.


INSTALLING CODEC PROGRAMS
----------------------------------------------

Linux and other Unixes
-------------------------------------
Both FFMPEG and MENCODER should be available in all major distributions. You may have to add repositories if default repositories do not have these porgrams available.

1) Command line install

Ubuntu:
Open terminal and give command: sudo apt-get install mencoder ffmpeg

(We will add instructions for other distributions as soon as someone running those distributions will send us some.)

2) GUI install

Ubuntu:
System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager. Then when program is running type words 'ffmpeg' and 'mencoder' in Quick Search and select packages and do install.


(We will add instructions for other distributions as soon as someone running those distributions will send us some.)
